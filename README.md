# Pistachio Image Denoising with Autoencoder 🌰✨  
This project was developed as part of my Deep Learning final exam. The goal is to denoise pistachio images by removing Gaussian noise using an Autoencoder architecture.  

## ✨ Project Overview  
- **Dataset**: Pistachio image dataset (train/test split with noisy + clean pairs).  
- **Objective**: Reconstruct clean pistachio images from noisy inputs.  
- **Models**:  
  - Baseline Autoencoder  
  - Modified Autoencoder (deeper layers, tuned hyperparameters)  
- **Evaluation**: Compared training/validation loss (MSE) and visual inspection of denoised images.  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Both baseline and modified autoencoders successfully reduced noise in images.  
- The modified autoencoder achieved better reconstruction quality and lower loss values.  
- Visual inspection confirmed cleaner outputs with less distortion, though small details were sometimes lost.  
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of autoencoders for image denoising tasks.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Train with more data or longer epochs to improve reconstruction quality.
